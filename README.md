# Code of [my blog](http://dagrevis.lv/ "daGrevis.lv") (based on [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/ "Kohana") 3.2)

## How to get it working?

1. Get `system/` directory of Kohana 3.2 and place it in `/`,
2. Get the needed modules (in `application/bootstrap.php` you can find the list),
3. Adjust `.htaccess` and `application/bootstrap.php`,
4. Adjust all needed files in `application/config` (like `database.php`),
5. Execute all SQL scripts from `application/sql`;
